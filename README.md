#  impluse engine: Driving HFS volumes forward

Got an old-school HFS (Mac OS Standard) volume that you can't mount anymore since macOS dropped support for it?

impluse is an open-source tool that converts HFS volumes into HFS+ (Mac OS Extended) volumes that you can then mount.

impluse is:

- intentionally misspelled (it's “impulse” rearranged to have “plus” in it)
- still pronounced “impulse” though
- not an in-place converter: you must have a source and a destination (such as a read-only disk image, and an empty disk image large enough to hold its contents)
- a command-line tool, for now
- for modern macOS machines (Catalina and later)
- ⚠️ brand-new and untested ⚠️

impluse does not guarantee to:
- maintain locations of files within each volume
- change locations of files within each volume (e.g., don't expect it to defragment or prune free space)
- change allocation block size (HFS+ can, theoretically, have a smaller allocation block size for many/most volumes, which was one of its selling points over HFS)
- maintain the same allocation block size
- preserve catalog or extents-overflow entries for deleted files (if such entries exist in either file but are not reachable from the root file/folder node)
- prune catalog or extents-overflow entries for deleted files
- decode filenames correctly (there may be an option at some point to specify an encoding hint)
- extract working aliases in all cases (extracted aliases need to be reconnected to their destinations, which isn't always feasible)
- produce the optimal HFS+ volume for the input contents (e.g., DiskWarrior or PlusOptimizer may have a lot of improvements to suggest)
- produce an HFS wrapper volume for the HFS+ output

impluse's goals *do* include:
- reproduce file contents, including resource forks, accurately (should be testable by hashing any file on both volumes)
- reproduce file metadata, excluding filenames, accurately (e.g., creation/modification dates shouldn't change)
- produce a volume that mounts successfully on modern macOS, at least read-only
- pass HFS+ consistency checks (fsck, DiskWarrior, etc.)

## What impluse can do

There are two ways to use impluse.

One is as an “unzipper” that can treat an HFS volume like a zip archive. `impluse list` will produce the entire folder and file hierarchy from an HFS volume. `impluse extract` will extract items by name or path. If you extract a folder, all of its contents will be extracted as well. You should extract items to an HFS+ or APFS volume, because impluse will try to reproduce as much as it can from the original volume, including resource forks and Finder flags (so, for example, aliases will still be aliases).

The other is as a converter from HFS to HFS+. (If you remember Alsoft's old PlusMaker product, this is like that, but uglier.) `impluse convert` takes two pathnames, one containing the HFS volume to read from, and the other being a file or device to write the HFS+ volume to. *IMPORTANT:* If you pass a device (or existing file) to `impluse convert`, impluse will simply overwrite it without asking. Be very careful in checking for typos!

Because impluse is a new, sparsely-tested program, I highly recommend preserving a verbatim copy of your HFS volumes alongside any converted HFS+ images or extracted data. It would suck if you found a defect in the converted/extracted copy and had no original to redo the operation from.

## Getting an HFS volume where impluse can see it

### Reading from physical devices (CDs, HDDs, etc.)

If you have a physical device such as a hard disk or CD-ROM that is formatted as HFS, my recommendation (and in some cases a necessity) is to image the device first. I recommend imaging it as UDIF (.dmg), as that format will include checksums to detect corruption of the original image. This image becomes your verbatim original for preservation (i.e., don't delete the image when you're done) and any future extractions or conversions.

First you will need to attach the device.

- For a hard disk drive: Plug your HDD into a USB port. macOS will present a prompt asking whether you want to initialize, ignore, or eject the volume. **Choose Ignore.** (Note that “Initialize” means “erase everything”!)
- For a CD-ROM: Insert the CD. macOS will present a prompt asking whether you want to ignore or eject the volume. **Choose Ignore.**

In either case, nothing further will happen. The volume won't mount on the desktop, since macOS doesn't support HFS, and (if it's a CD or other removable disk) it won't be ejected.

Now that it's attached, you can image it. You can do this in Disk Utility, though I recommend using `hdiutil` instead, as it gives you more precise control over what will be imaged and how.

Use `diskutil list` to find which device is the one you've just connected. One way is to run `diskutil list` before connecting/inserting the disk and run it again after, and rule out any devices that were already present. The one that's only in the “after” output is the one you want.

All of the devices have identifiers like “diskX”, “diskXsY”, or “diskXsYsZ”, where X is the top-level device number and Y and Z are subdevice numbers. “diskXsY” is subdevice Y of device X, and “diskXsYsZ” is a subdevice of a subdevice.

You'll see devices of type “`CD_partition_scheme`” (if the device is a physical CD-ROM), “`Apple_partition_scheme`” (if the device is formatted with an Apple Partition Map), “`Apple_HFS`”, and some others. You want “`Apple_partition_scheme`” if that's present, or “`Apple_HFS`” if not.

(Imaging the `Apple_HFS` device will give you a raw HFS image that impluse can read from directly, but this is not as good for preservation. I recommend imaging the `Apple_partition_scheme` device for a more complete original, and then attaching the image in the subsequent step.)

To image the device, use:

- `hdiutil create -format UDBZ -srcdevice /dev/diskXsY -o "My Image.dmg"`

For CD-ROMs, you'll typically want the first subdevice, diskXs1. For hard drives and most other devices, you're more likely to want the top-level device, diskX. (Each of these is most likely to be the one labeled “`Apple_partition_scheme`” as noted above, though if there's only a bare HFS volume with no partition map, the device may have no type label at all.)

### If you get a “permission denied” error when attempting to image a device

At least with CD-ROMs, macOS has a habit of attaching the subdevices as owned by the `root` user and not by you. This means you can read the top-level device (which is generally not the HFS volume), but not the subdevices (including the one that is the HFS volume).

This means that directly reading from or copying the subdevices as yourself will not work.

If you really want to create a raw image, you can copy the subdevices as root (`sudo cp …`).

My recommendation is to create a UDIF image. You can use `hdiutil create` as described above; hdiutil will prompt for authorization to read from the subdevice as root.

### Attaching an image

If you have a raw image (a file containing bytes directly copied from a device), you can attach it using `hdiutil`:

- `hdiutil attach -nomount -readonly path/to/image.img`

Raw images are the kind you typically use with emulators such as Mini vMac and SheepShaver. Note that if the image uses some other filename extension, such as .dsk, you'll need to rename or hard-link it to .img for the disk image engine to recognize it as a raw image.

If you have a wrapped disk image such as a UDIF (.dmg) image, you will need to attach it. Use this hdiutil command:

- `hdiutil attach -nomount -readonly path/to/image.dmg`

Now the image is attached as a device, and hdiutil has printed a list of one or more devices.

If it gave you only one device path with no further description, use that.

If it gave you a list like:

```
/dev/diskX          	Apple_partition_scheme         	
/dev/diskXs1        	Apple_partition_map            	
/dev/diskXs2        	Apple_Driver43_CD              	
/dev/diskXs3        	Apple_Driver_ATAPI             	
/dev/diskXs4        	Apple_Driver43                 	
/dev/diskXs5        	Apple_Driver_ATAPI             	
/dev/diskXs6        	Apple_Patches                  	
/dev/diskXs7        	Apple_HFS                      	
/dev/diskXs8        	Apple_Driver43                 	
```

You want the one labeled “`Apple_HFS`”.

From this point, you can use the good-old-fashioned `cp` command to copy the indicated device to a raw HFS image file, or you can point impluse to that device directly.

If you get a list of partitions but there is no “`Apple_HFS`” partition, then it's not an HFS volume and impluse cannot do anything with it.

If you get a list with multiple “`Apple_HFS`” partitions, then there are multiple HFS partitions (most likely for a partitioned hard drive). You can create a raw HFS image file from, or use impluse directly with, each partition separately.

### What you can do with impluse

Pick out the diskXsY or diskXsYsZ that corresponds to “Apple_HFS”, then feed it to `impluse convert` or `impluse extract`:

- `impluse convert /dev/diskXsY "Insert Name Here-HFS+.img"`
- `impluse extract /dev/diskXsY ':'`

':' is a path to the root of the volume; this path will tell `extract` to extract the whole volume as a folder. The folder will have the name of the volume.

Both operations are quite fast; they will typically be limited by the speed of I/O (e.g., if you're reading directly from a CD, this will be limited by the speed of your CD drive).

### On bare HFS volumes, such as floppies
A storage device that isn't big enough to make sense to partition will often omit the partition map entirely, containing only a bare HFS volume. Often these are floppy disks, or images thereof.

Floppy images for emulators like Mini vMac and SheepShaver will generally be raw images. Floppy images distributed by Apple or other companies are more likely in a wrapped format like NDIF (which inconveniently uses the same .img extension), UDIF (.dmg), Disk Copy 4.2 (no extension), or self-mounting image applications (.smi). Recent versions of macOS have dropped support for pre-UDIF formats, which makes extracting HFS volumes from these much less convenient.

If you followed the instructions above, and then copied an “`Apple_HFS`” subdevice to a regular file, that file is a raw disk image of a bare HFS volume.

If you have a raw bare-HFS disk image file, impluse can read directly from it—no need to attach it.

If you try to use impluse with a file you think is an image of an HFS volume, but it doesn't work, there are several possible reasons why:

- impluse can only read from raw _HFS_ images, where the image file contains only the volume with no partition map around it. impluse does not currently know how to read a partition map. If you have an image file containing a partition map, you'll need to follow the steps above to attach the image and expose any HFS volumes that might be present.
- impluse also does not know how to read wrapped (non-raw) images. You'll need to attach these using the disk images system as described above.
- If you imaged a CD-ROM using its top-level device (`CD_partition_scheme`), that won't work—the data is wrapped in thousands of CD-ROM frame headers. These can be stripped out (with some other program), but it's safer to re-image the disc from the original physical copy.
