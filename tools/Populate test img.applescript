-- -*- coding: macintosh -*-(*This script populates a blank volume named “Test disk 10MB 2.0” (which it assumes is already mounted) with some files and folders that exercise various aspects of conversion and extraction.Run this script on a Mac OS 9 system on which you have created a 10 MB disk image named "Test disk 10MB 2.0", and mounted that image as writable.You probably should create the image with the "Mount image" checkbox turned off, then duplicate the image file and mount that working copy. Then, if you screw up the image somehow (like I did countless times while writing the script), you can throw out the working copy and re-duplicate the template copy for another attempt.TODO: Integrate some code to `tell application "Disk Copy"` to create and mount the image automatically, and then, at the end, tell the Finder to eject it.After creating, populating, and ejecting the image, you should create a compressed (and therefore both read-only and much smaller) copy of it. I recommend doing that on macOS, where you can create a compressed UDIF image that you can then attach for testing impluse.hdiutil convert -format UDBZ path/to/'Test disk 10MB 2.0.img' -o 'Test disk 10MB 2.0.dmg'hdiutil attach -nomount -readonly 'Test disk 10MB 2.0.dmg'*)tell application "Finder"	with transaction		set the_file to (open for access file "Test disk 10MB 2.0:Alpha.txt" with write permission)		write ("This is a test." & return) to the_file		close access the_file		ignoring application responses			set comment of file "Alpha.txt" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to "This file is a message… and part of a system of messages… pay attention to it!"						try				make new folder in disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" with properties {name:"Bravo"}			end try			set icon of folder "Bravo" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to icon of folder "Favorites" of folder "System Folder" of startup disk			try				make alias at folder "Bravo" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to file "Alpha.txt" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" with properties {name:"Charlie.txt"}			end try			try				make new folder in disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" with properties {name:"Delta"}			end try			set icon of folder "Delta" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to icon of folder "Utilities" of startup disk			try				make alias at folder "Delta" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to folder "Bravo" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" with properties {name:"Echo"}			end try			try				make alias at folder "Delta" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" to file "Charlie.txt" of folder "Bravo" of disk "Test disk 10MB 2.0" with properties {name:"Foxtrot.txt"}			end try					end ignoring	end transactionend tell
